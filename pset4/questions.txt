0.  BMP: 32 bit color i.e  over 4 billion.
    GIF: 8 bits or 256 colors.
    JPEG: 24 bit or 16 million.
    PNG: 24 bit or 16 million.
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless compression maintains both states which are recoverable from each other but lossy compression loses some part of it while compression which cannot be retrieved
3.  JPEG
4.  It's name first character gets modifies to show that file has been deleted and the respective space can be recycled and then file's data is never touched.
5.  Overwrite the disk so that the space ocuupied previously by files gets recycled.
6.  It's a set of definitions which defines ints of custom sizes to show sizes or widths etc.
7.  It lets us define the size of int for various purposes like u_int32_t means that thwe size of the int is 32 bits.
8.  BYTE is 1 byte
	DWORD is 4 bytes
	LONG is 4 bytes
	WORD is 2 bytes

9.  in hex : 0x424d this is stored in bftype
10. bfsize denotes the full size of the bmp file and bisize denotes the info size i.e 40 bytes of the bmp file.
11. If biHeight is negative it means that bitmap is a bottom up DIB which originates from bottom left corner.
12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap
13. when it's unable to find the file it will return NULL
14. Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always
    reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.
15. The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel + 3 padding = 12,
    which is a multiple of 4 which is required.
16. fseek skips over padding and looks for the next pixel that might matter to us.
17. An integer constant which, when used as the 'whence' argument to the
    fseek or fseeko function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to
    the current file position.
